## Frequently Asked Questions 


### I'm seeing a lot of suburbs that I definitely don't deliver to... I think they're from some other country? 

You need to add your ZONE REGIONS in Shipping Zone area. Make sure this is set to your COUNTRY (not state or other region).  Then go back and regenerate the suburbs list. This will fetch suburbs again, this time limiting by region.
